# Hugo Valet Driver

This is a very simple Laravel Valet driver for serving static sites, specifically ones generated by [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo). It looks for `config.toml`, `config.yaml`, or `config.json` file in the project root, along with a `public` folder, to indicate that it should be the active driver. Simply download the `HugoValetDriver.php` driver and place it in your `~/.config/valet/Drivers` directory.

```bash
cd ~/.config/valet/Drivers
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amsoell/laravel-valet-hugo-driver/master/HugoValetDriver.php
```
